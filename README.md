# Project 1: Aloha Apparel Co.
This is a thoughtful write-up about my project...
My project was to create a homepage for a client at Aloha Apparel Co. using HTML and CSS.

I also added interactivity to this website with JS, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout with flexbox (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This website's homepage is responsive to mobiles, tablets and desktops.
